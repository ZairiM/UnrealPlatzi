The game starts in a game map, there is a Player and an enemy’s spawner.

The game starts and you can see the map, then you must shoot to the enemies, you
can defeat the enemies, and the enemy’s spawner create more (always 6 in the
map), you can pick up ammunition (Max 100), you lose when you die, then you lose
your points and start again.

The map and some components are imported from Epic Games Marketplace.
